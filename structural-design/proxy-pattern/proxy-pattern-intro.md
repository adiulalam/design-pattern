# Introduction to Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It acts as an intermediary or a wrapper around the real object, allowing you to add extra behavior or control access to the underlying object without modifying its code. This pattern is useful for implementing lazy initialization, access control, logging, caching, and other cross-cutting concerns.

## When to Use Proxy Pattern:

- When you want to control access to an object or add extra behavior without modifying its code.
- When you need to implement lazy initialization of objects, where the real object is only created when needed.
- When you want to add logging, caching, access control, or other cross-cutting concerns to objects transparently.

## Benefits of Proxy Pattern:

- **Controlled Access:** Allows you to control access to the underlying object, enforcing access policies or adding additional security measures.
- **Lazy Initialization:** Supports lazy initialization of objects, where the real object is created only when needed, improving performance and resource usage.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Enables separation of concerns by encapsulating cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, or access control in a proxy object.
- **Improved Performance:** Facilitates optimizations such as caching or memoization to improve the performance of operations.
