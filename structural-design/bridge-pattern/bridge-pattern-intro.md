# Introduction to Bridge Pattern

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. It decouples abstraction and implementation by providing a bridge interface that encapsulates the implementation details and delegates the abstraction's requests to the appropriate implementation object. This pattern promotes flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability by enabling changes in abstraction and implementation independently without affecting each other.

## When to Use Bridge Pattern:

- When you need to separate the abstraction and implementation to allow them to vary independently.
- When you have multiple implementations of an abstraction and want to avoid a combinatorial explosion of subclasses.
- When you want to hide implementation details from clients and provide a stable abstraction interface.

## Benefits of Bridge Pattern:

- **Decoupling:** Separates abstraction from implementation, reducing dependencies and promoting decoupling.
- **Flexibility:** Allows abstraction and implementation to vary independently, providing flexibility in design.
- **Extensibility:** Enables easy addition of new abstractions or implementations without modifying existing code.
- **Simplifies Hierarchy:** Avoids a large number of subclass combinations, simplifying the class hierarchy and improving maintainability.
