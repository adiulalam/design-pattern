# Introduction to Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. This pattern enables collaboration between objects that couldn't otherwise interact due to incompatible interfaces, promoting reusability and flexibility.

## When to Use Adapter Pattern:

- When you need to use an existing class with an incompatible interface without modifying its source code.
- When you want to reuse existing classes in different contexts that require a different interface.
- When you want to create a reusable component that can work with multiple classes or systems with different interfaces.

## Benefits of Adapter Pattern:

- **Interoperability:** Allows objects with different interfaces to work together, promoting interoperability between components.
- **Reuse and Flexibility:** Enables the reuse of existing classes and components in different contexts by adapting their interfaces.
- **Encapsulation:** Adapters encapsulate the conversion logic, keeping it separate from the client code and enhancing maintainability.
