# Introduction to Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is an extension of the Factory Method Pattern and is used when a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

## When to Use Abstract Factory Pattern:

- When a system should be configured with multiple families of objects.
- When a family of related or dependent objects must be created, ensuring their compatibility.
- When the system needs to be easily extendable with new product variants.

## Benefits of Abstract Factory Pattern:

- **Abstracted Object Creation:** The pattern abstracts the process of object creation, allowing clients to create families of objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Ensures Compatibility:** Objects created by a factory are guaranteed to be compatible, ensuring that the entire family of objects works seamlessly together.
- **Easily Extensible:** It facilitates the addition of new variants to the system without modifying existing code.
