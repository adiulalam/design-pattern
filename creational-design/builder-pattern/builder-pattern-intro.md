# Introduction to Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It provides a step-by-step approach to build a complex object, where each step is defined by a builder interface. This pattern is useful when an object has a complex construction process with multiple steps or when you want to create different configurations of the same object.

## When to Use Builder Pattern:

- When a class needs to create an instance with a large number of possible configurations.
- When the construction process is complex and should be isolated from the final representation.
- When you want to ensure that the construction process is consistent and produces valid objects.

## Benefits of Builder Pattern:

- **Separation of Concerns:** The pattern separates the construction logic from the representation, making the code more maintainable and extensible.
- **Step-by-Step Construction:** Builders provide a step-by-step approach to build an object, allowing you to control and customize each step of the process.
- **Reusability:** Builders can be reused to create different representations of the same object.
