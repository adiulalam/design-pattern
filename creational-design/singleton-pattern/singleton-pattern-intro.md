# Introduction to Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to control access to a shared resource, such as a configuration manager, logging service, or database connection, and avoid the unnecessary creation of multiple instances.

## When to Use the Singleton Pattern

- **Global Configuration:** When you need a single point to manage and access global configuration settings throughout your application.

- **Logging Services:** For creating a single logging service that handles log messages across various components.

- **Database Connections:** When you want a single connection to a database to be shared across different parts of the application.

## Benefits of the Singleton Pattern

- **Global Access:** The Singleton Pattern provides a globally accessible point to the same instance, ensuring consistency in data and behavior.

- **Resource Management:** It helps in efficient resource management, preventing the unnecessary creation of multiple instances of a resource-intensive object.

- **Simplified Access:** Provides a simple and centralized way to access shared resources or services without the need for global variables.
