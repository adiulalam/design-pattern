# Introduction to Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is widely used to implement distributed event handling systems, where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, known as observers, and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

## When to Use Observer Pattern:

- When changes in the state of one object may require changing the state of other objects.
- When a group of objects needs to be informed about the changes of another object.
- When an object should notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are.

## Benefits of Observer Pattern:

- **Decoupling of Components:** The pattern promotes loose coupling between subjects and observers, allowing them to vary and evolve independently.
- **Supports Broadcast Communication:** Observers can register and unregister dynamically at runtime, enabling flexible communication.
- **Promotes Reusability:** Objects can be reused as observers in different contexts, enhancing code modularity and reusability.
