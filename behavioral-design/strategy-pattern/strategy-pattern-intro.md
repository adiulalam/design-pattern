# Introduction to Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an algorithm to be selected at runtime from a family of algorithms. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it, providing flexibility and promoting code reuse.

## When to Use Strategy Pattern:

- When you need to define a class that has multiple behaviors or algorithms and want to make these interchangeable.
- When you have a class with a complex conditional logic that can be replaced with a set of interchangeable algorithms.
- When you want to isolate the implementation details of an algorithm from the client code that uses it.

## Benefits of Strategy Pattern:

- **Flexibility and Extensibility:** The pattern allows for dynamic selection of algorithms at runtime, providing flexibility in behavior.
- **Encapsulation:** Each algorithm is encapsulated into its own class or function, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Promotes Code Reuse:** Strategies can be reused across different contexts and algorithms, reducing duplication and enhancing code modularity.
