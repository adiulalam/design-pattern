# Introduction to Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows multiple objects to handle a request without the client needing to know which object will handle it. It creates a chain of handler objects, where each handler has the capability to either handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern promotes loose coupling and flexibility in handling requests, making it useful for implementing filters, event propagation, and error handling systems.

## When to Use Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

- When the processing of a request needs to be handled by multiple objects in a particular order.
- When the set of objects that can handle a request should be dynamically defined.
- When you want to decouple the sender of a request from its receivers and avoid a fixed set of handlers.

## Benefits of Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

- **Decouples Sender and Receiver:** The pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers, allowing them to vary independently.
- **Flexibility and Extensibility:** Handlers can be added, removed, or reordered dynamically, providing flexibility and extensibility in processing requests.
- **Promotes Single Responsibility:** Each handler is responsible for a specific task, promoting the Single Responsibility Principle and ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
