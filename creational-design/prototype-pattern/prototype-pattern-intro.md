# Introduction to Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows the creation of new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. Instead of creating new instances using a constructor, the pattern involves cloning an existing object and then customizing it as needed. This pattern is beneficial when the cost of creating a new instance by copying an existing one is less than creating it from scratch.

## When to Use Prototype Pattern:

- When the classes to instantiate are specified at runtime, for example, by dynamic loading.
- When instances of a class can have one of only a few different combinations of state, and it is more convenient to copy an existing instance than to create a new one.
- When the client code should not be aware of the concrete classes it is working with.

## Benefits of Prototype Pattern:

- **Reduced Object Creation Cost:** Cloning an existing object is generally faster and more efficient than creating a new one from scratch.
- **Dynamic Object Creation:** The pattern allows for creating new objects at runtime based on existing prototypes.
- **Easy Customization:** Instances can be customized after cloning to suit specific needs.
