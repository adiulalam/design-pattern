# Introduction to Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating instances of a class but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes flexibility in object creation by letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate, deferred until runtime.

## When to Use Factory Method Pattern:

- When a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it needs to create.
- When a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
- When a class delegates the responsibility of instantiating its objects to its subclasses.

## Benefits of Factory Method Pattern:

- **Flexibility and Extensibility:** The Factory Method Pattern allows for dynamic object creation, making it easy to introduce new product variations without modifying existing code.
- **Encapsulation:** The pattern encapsulates the object creation process, ensuring that the details are hidden from the client code.
- **Code Reusability:** By providing an interface for creating objects, the pattern promotes code reuse and adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.
