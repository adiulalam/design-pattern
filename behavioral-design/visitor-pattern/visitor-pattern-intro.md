# Introduction to Visitor Pattern

The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to existing classes without modifying those classes. It achieves this by separating the behavior from the object structure on which it operates. The pattern defines a visitor interface with a visit method for each type of element in the object structure. Concrete visitor classes implement these methods to provide specific behaviors for each element type. This pattern promotes open/closed principle and enables the addition of new operations without modifying existing classes, making it useful for scenarios where behavior needs to be added or extended dynamically.

## When to Use Visitor Pattern:

- When you have a complex object structure with multiple types of elements, and you want to add new operations to these elements without modifying their classes.
- When you want to avoid tight coupling between behavior and object structure, allowing for easier maintenance and extension.
- When you have behavior that depends on the object's type and needs to be separated from the object's class hierarchy.

## Benefits of Visitor Pattern:

- **Open/Closed Principle:** The pattern allows new operations to be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the open/closed principle.
- **Separation of Concerns:** It separates the behavior from the object structure, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Flexibility and Extensibility:** New operations can be added dynamically by implementing new visitor classes, providing flexibility and extensibility.
