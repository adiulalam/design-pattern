# Introduction to Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures. These patterns help define clear and efficient ways to organize code, manage relationships between objects, and enhance the overall architecture of a software system.

## Types of Structural Design Patterns

### 1. **Adapter Pattern:**
   - Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.

### 2. **Bridge Pattern:**
   - Separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### 3. **Composite Pattern:**
   - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

### 4. **Decorator Pattern:**
   - Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

### 5. **Facade Pattern:**
   - Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

### 6. **Proxy Pattern:**
   - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## When to Use Structural Design Patterns

- **Adapter:**
  - Use when you want to use an existing class with an incompatible interface, or when you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated classes.

- **Bridge:**
  - Use when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.

- **Composite:**
  - Use when clients should be able to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

- **Decorator:**
  - Use when you want to add or alter the responsibilities of objects without modifying their code directly.

- **Facade:**
  - Use when you want to provide a simple and unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

- **Proxy:**
  - Use when you want to control access to an object or when you need to add additional functionality to an object.

## Benefits of Structural Design Patterns

- **Flexibility and Extensibility:**
  - Structural patterns enhance the flexibility and extensibility of a system by promoting clear object composition and relationships.

- **Code Organization:**
  - These patterns provide a systematic way to organize code, making it more understandable and maintainable.

- **Promotion of Best Practices:**
  - By following structural design patterns, developers adhere to best practices for organizing code and building scalable systems.

Structural design patterns play a crucial role in shaping the architecture of a software system by organizing and managing the relationships between classes and objects in a coherent manner.
