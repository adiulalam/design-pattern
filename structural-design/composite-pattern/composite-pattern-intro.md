# Introduction to Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, enabling clients to work with both single objects and compositions in a consistent manner. This pattern facilitates the creation of complex hierarchical structures while keeping the interface simple and allowing clients to interact with objects at different levels of abstraction.

## When to Use Composite Pattern:

- When you need to represent part-whole hierarchies where objects can be composed into larger structures.
- When you want clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- When you need to add new types of components to the hierarchy without changing the existing code.

## Benefits of Composite Pattern:

- **Uniformity:** Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, simplifying client code.
- **Flexibility:** Allows the creation of complex structures and supports recursive composition of objects.
- **Simplified Client Code:** Clients can work with objects at different levels of abstraction using a common interface.
- **Ease of Extension:** Enables easy addition of new types of components to the hierarchy without modifying existing code.
