# Introduction to Command Pattern

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing clients to parameterize operations, queue requests, and support undoable operations. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from the receiver, providing flexibility, extensibility, and ease of implementation of functionality like command queuing, logging, and transactional behavior.

## When to Use Command Pattern:

- When you want to parameterize objects by encapsulating a request as an object.
- When you need to queue requests, execute them at different times, or undo/redo functionality.
- When you want to support transactional behavior or logging of requests.

## Benefits of Command Pattern:

- **Decouples Sender and Receiver:** The pattern separates the request sender from the request receiver, allowing them to vary independently.
- **Supports Undoable Operations:** Commands encapsulate operations, making it easy to implement undo/redo functionality.
- **Flexible and Extensible:** Commands can be easily combined and extended to create new functionality, promoting code reusability and modularity.
