# Introduction to Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, making it easier to use. It acts as a higher-level interface that hides the complexities of the underlying system and provides a unified interface to interact with it. This pattern promotes loose coupling by decoupling clients from the complexities of the subsystem, thus simplifying client code and improving code readability and maintainability.

## When to Use Facade Pattern:

- When you need to provide a simple interface to a complex system or library.
- When you want to decouple clients from the internal details and dependencies of a subsystem.
- When you need to reduce the complexity of client code by encapsulating interactions with a subsystem.

## Benefits of Facade Pattern:

- **Simplified Interface:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.
- **Decoupling:** Decouples clients from the internal details and dependencies of a subsystem, promoting loose coupling.
- **Code Organization:** Improves code organization by encapsulating interactions with a subsystem behind a facade.
- **Easier Maintenance:** Simplifies maintenance by isolating changes within the facade and hiding them from clients.
