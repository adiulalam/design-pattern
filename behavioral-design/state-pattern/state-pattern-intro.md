# Introduction to State Pattern

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates the state of an object into separate state classes and delegates the behavior associated with each state to the respective state class. This pattern promotes cleaner and more modular code by separating concerns related to state transitions and behavior, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## When to Use State Pattern:

- When the behavior of an object changes based on its internal state, leading to multiple conditional statements.
- When an object has a finite set of states and the transitions between states are well-defined.
- When you want to avoid long switch-case or if-else statements by encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate classes.

## Benefits of State Pattern:

- **Encapsulated State Logic:** State classes encapsulate the behavior associated with each state, promoting cleaner and more modular code.
- **Simplified State Transitions:** The pattern simplifies state transitions by delegating them to individual state classes.
- **Promotes Single Responsibility:** Each state class is responsible for handling behavior related to its specific state, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
